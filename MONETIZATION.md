# 💰 ProspectPilot Monetization Strategy

## Core Principle: Sell Outcomes, Not Code

Your buyers pay for **leads, candidates, enrichment, market intelligence, automations that save hours, and tools that help them win contracts**. They do NOT want to pay for repos, templates, or schemas.

They want: **"Push button → get value."**

The GitHub repo is NOT the product. It's:
- Proof of work
- Developer documentation
- A marketing asset
- A reason you can charge high rates
- The engine behind the services you sell

---

## Reality-Based Pricing

These price points match actual buyer willingness for automation/scraping/AI-driven deal discovery tools:

### 1. Done-for-You Pipeline Setup — $750

A 1–2 hour job for you that your market GLADLY pays for.

**You deliver:**
- Supabase schema deployed
- Render deployment configured
- ATS/tech stack detection live
- Email alerts configured
- Daily scrape running
- Dashboard access
- AI summaries enabled

**Price:** $750 flat (easily sell 3–5 per month)

---

### 2. Pipeline-as-a-Service Subscription — $99–$499/mo

This is the most profitable model. Think: daily scraping, hidden job alerts, lead enrichment, AI deal insights, automatic uploads into HubSpot or Salesforce.

| Tier | Price | Domains | Features |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Starter** | $99/mo | 25 domains | Daily scrape, alerts, basic enrichment |
| **Growth** | $149/mo | 50 domains | + AI deal insights, priority support |
| **Scale** | $249/mo | 100 domains | + HubSpot/Salesforce sync |
| **Enterprise** | $499/mo | Custom | White-label, custom integrations |

---

### 3. Recruiter Deal Alerts — $49/mo

Lightweight alternative targeting recruiting agencies:

- Monitors client websites for new job postings
- Extracts newly posted jobs automatically
- Sends Slack/Email/SMS alerts
- AI ranking of "hot leads" by deal potential

This is exactly what jobspy.io charges — your version is better.

---

### 4. Outbound Machine Build for Agencies — $2,500

Full implementation for agencies and BD teams.

**Deliverables:**
- Fully automated scraping pipeline
- Deal intelligence and lead scoring
- Persona-aware outreach engine
- HubSpot → Render → Supabase integration
- Data enrichment flows
- Training session

**Price:** $2,500 (can push $3,500 with ease in this market)

---

### 5. Custom CRM Integration — $4,000–$10,000

When you combine AI + HubSpot + RevOps logic + scraping + reporting, you're in the $5K–$15K range. This is normal, not inflated.

**Examples:**
- HubSpot bidirectional sync with deal scoring
- Salesforce integration with custom objects
- Custom webhook pipelines to existing tools
- White-label dashboard for client's brand

---

### 6. Complete Agency Automations Suite — $7,500+

A full stack for recruiting or BD agencies:

- Job scraper with ATS detection
- Client alerts and notifications
- Multi-channel outbound engine
- AI research agents
- Enrichment flows
- Custom dashboard
- SOPs and training

Every small recruiting or BD agency is used to paying $15–50K for software implementations. **$7,500 is an easy sell.**

Use the repo as an **anchor**, not a product:

- "Open-source core is free — paid plan adds: alerts, scheduler, ATS detection, concurrency, dashboard, HubSpot sync."
- "Repo available for free — done-for-you setup is $750."
- "Self-host: free. Managed: $149/mo."

## Bottom Line

Price accordingly.
